 # M.O.M. - Mind of Matter

## Description
Welcome to Mind of Matter (M.O.M.), an app focused on improving your mental health through daily journaling. We understand that mental health is a crucial aspect of overall wellness, and we believe that daily reflection and tracking can help you gain insights into your mental state and promote positive changes in your life. At M.O.M., we strive to stand out from other mental health apps by using OpenAI APIs to provide you with personalized insights and recommendations based on your journal entries. By analyzing your language and sentiment, we can offer you tailored advice, exercises, and resources to support your mental well-being. Our user-friendly interface makes it easy to input your daily experiences, thoughts, and feelings in a private and secure environment. You can track your progress over time, identify patterns, and gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your emotions. We believe that mental health is for everyone, and we hope that M.O.M. can help you take control of your well-being and lead a happier, healthier life. Thank you for choosing Mind of Matter!


## How it works
For the front-end, we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(Svelte) to create an intuitive and engaging user experience. For the back-end, we use Express JS and JSON to handle data processing and storage. With this data, we will implement a sentiment score using the NLP MANAGER library for this. With numbers, they can check how well their mental health improves. This is still being discussed. With every mental health improvement, possibly then an OpenAI Chatbot (currently figuring out what api to use)  can congratulate the user on feeling better about themselves. Dependent on the sentiment score will result in a specific gif.
